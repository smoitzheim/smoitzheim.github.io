<p>Love Jet Lag The Game, get they wanna sell their product, but they need to stop playing that Hide &amp; Seek &ldquo;home game&rdquo; on the show or at least take out the goddamn time bonuses. A game show made for entertainment should not have a &ldquo;you win without doing anything interesting&rdquo; mechanic.</p>
