  <p>Kyle Mooney <a href="https://www.cracked.com/article_44727_an-snl-producer-suggested-that-future-generations-will-study-cast-members-ptsd.html?newsletter-cat=movies-tv">über SNL</a>: „[W]e must all agree it’s not a healthy place to be.“</p>
<blockquote><p>Mooney also recalled that SNL producer Erik Kenward once suggested that in “20, 30, 40 years, there might be some sort of study about PTSD associated with people who worked at that show, because it is such an intense onslaught,” adding that “it's definitely not good for you. There’s no way it is.”</p></blockquote>
